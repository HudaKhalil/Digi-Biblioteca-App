# Digi-Biblioteca Project

In the My Digi-Biblioteca project, I create a bookshelf app that allows you to:

* Search for books based on title and author.
* Categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library.

This project [Starter Code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) provided from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as part of [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
